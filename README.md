# login-registration

It's a login registration app with Java Spring Boot, Thymeleaf and MySQL. But i didn't used Spring Security. I've checked the email-password validity while login at the service.

There is a Many-to-Many connection between users and roles databases.

I don't know too much about frontend at the moment. So the html codes are amateur work.
